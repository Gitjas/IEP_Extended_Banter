## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The goal of this mod is to ensure that each Bioware NPC gets their fair share of banters with each other. We also intend to expand on friendships and relationships between the various NPCs; the friendship between Mazzy and Aerie, for example, or the peculiar relationship between Jaheira and Viconia. Currently, the mod includes banters mainly for Shadows of Amn, with two for ToB (between Minsc and Aerie).

We hope you enjoy this mod as much as we have enjoyed making it!

Visit the <a href="http://www.spellholdstudios.net/ie/iepbanters">website</a> or <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/530-iep-extended-banters/">forum</a> for all the latest updates.

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with and without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

IEP Extended Banter mod should be compatible with all WeiDU mods, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. It has been tested on several different installations, and has so far worked perfectly. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/530-iep-extended-banters/">report them on the forum!

Keep in mind that the IEP Banter Accelerator will un-install any previously installed banter accelerator, including the accelerator included in BG1 NPC. This is for compatibility reasons, but it does mean that you should take care with larger installations including other accelerators.

>Although it is not required for the IEP Extended Banter to function properly, it is always a good idea to install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-iepbanters.exe`**, un-install the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: iepbanters folder.</em>

<em>When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: iepbanters folder and a setup-iepbanters.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-iepbanters.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-iepbanters.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-iepbanters --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *DESIGNATED* number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.


**0. Extended NPC-NPC Interaction SoA**<br />

This component adds numerous banters between the Bioware NPCs, humorous, serious or otherwise. Your companions are people too - surely they deserve more talking time! This release includes the following banters for SoA:

- Aerie/Anomen [2]
- Aerie/Imoen [3]
- Aerie/Mazzy [8]
- Aerie/Minsc [4]
- Aerie/Valygar [2]
- Aerie/Yoshimo [1]
- Anomen/Viconia [2]
- Anomen/Minsc [4]
- Cernd/Imoen [1]
- Cernd/Viconia [2]
- Edwin/Viconia [5]
- Haer'Dalis/Imoen [1]
- Haer'Dalis/Minsc [1]
- Imoen/Jaheira [2]
- Imoen/Korgan [2]
- Imoen/Minsc [3]
- Imoen/Viconia [3]
- Jaheira/Minsc [2]
- Jaheira/Keldorn [2]
- Jaheira/Viconia [8]
- Keldorn/Valygar [2]
- Korgan/Viconia [2]
- Minsc/Viconia [1]
- Nalia/Viconia [3]
- Valygar/Viconia [2]
- Viconia/Yoshimo [1]

## 

**1. Extended Minsc/Aerie Interaction ToB**

This component includes two banters for Aerie and Minsc in Throne of Bhaal.

## 

**2. Imoen "Retrospection" dialogue for BGII: ToB**

This component adds a new dialogue with your foster-sister Imoen in Throne of Bhaal.

## 

**3. Wake-Up dialogue for Anomen Romance (By David Gaider with additions from Kulyok)**

This component adds a new dialogue to the Anomen romance. In the original romance, there was no "morning after" dialogue with Anomen for after you had slept with him, something that both fans and the original writer of the Anomen Romance, David Gaider, found unsatisfactory. This component adds a morning after dialogue written by David Gaider on the Attic forums with additions from Kulyok.

## 

**4. NPC Conflict Revisions**

This component includes conflict revisions, which allow the PC to intervene before NPC disagreements turn ugly. It revises the following conflicts:

- Edwin/Keldorn
- Edwin/Minsc
- Edwin/Valygar
- Keldorn/Viconia

## 

**5. Restored Aerie/Jaheira/Anomen interjection in Underdark**

This component, strangely enough, restores an interjection into the Underdark if you're in a romance with them.

## 

**Banter Accelerator**
**6. 10 Minutes**
**7. 15 Minutes**
**8. 20 Minutes**
**9. 30 Minutes**
**10. 45 Minutes**
**11. 60 Minutes**

This component is a more customizable version of jcompton's Banter Accelerator script available in the <a href="http://www.pocketplane.net/banter">PPG Banter Pack</a>, modified and redistributed with permission.
