<div align="center"><h1></a>IEP Extended Banter</h1>

<h3>A Spellhold Studios mod for Baldur's Gate 2: SoA - Throne of Bhaal<h3>

</div><br />

 The goal of this mod is to ensure that each Bioware NPC gets their fair share of banters with each other. We also intend to expand on friendships and relationships between the various NPCs; the friendship between Mazzy and Aerie, for example, or the peculiar relationship between Jaheira and Viconia. Currently, the mod includes banters mainly for Shadows of Amn, with two for ToB (between Minsc and Aerie).

We hope you enjoy this mod as much as we have enjoyed making it!
